# overland-water-flow-modelling
This repository contains a script that was developed for the modelling of overland flow using the SIMWE model as part of my master's thesis.

Detailed information on how to use the script can be found in the documentation, located in [overland-water-flow-modelling/documentation](https://github.com/haag-s/overland-water-flow-modelling/tree/main/documentation).
